# Project 2: I'm Going to Disney World!
A project that analyzes the rides of Disney World and looks at what makes an attraction highly rated by guests.

As a Florida resident, rollercoaster enthusiast, and Annual Passholder at Walt Disney World, I chose to investigate a topic I hold dearly; amusement park rides.

I worked with a small dataset I retrieved from [data.world](https://data.world/lynne588/walt-disney-world-ride-data/workspace/file?filename=WDW_Ride_Data_DW.xlsx)  in order to analyze what it is that makes a ride enjoyable, i.e. rated highly, by its guests. I hope that through this project I can analyze and spot trends which can be used for future attractions, as well as extend to other theme parks.

Concerns regarding this project would be that due to the small data set, it may be hard to truly generalize findings. High correlations will be identified and dealt with appropriately.
